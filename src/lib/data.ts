      "Enterprise AI is not a prompt. It is a system of records, permissions, and failure modes. When I built an agentic research layer over Pakistan higher-court judgments, the interesting work was not the chat UI. It was chunking, metadata, and the discipline of refusing to speak without a source.",
      "The same pattern showed up inside professional-services workflows. An audit firm does not want a clever intern in a box. It wants a system that can draft, search, and route — then leave a trail. Retrieval-augmented generation is useful there only if the corpus is trustworthy and the model is not allowed to bluff.",
      "I now start every AI conversation with three questions. What is the source of truth? Who is allowed to see it? What happens when the model is uncertain? If those answers are vague, the interface can be beautiful and the product is still a liability.",
      "Taste still matters. Latency, empty states, and the way citations are presented decide whether people trust the tool enough to use it twice. But taste without retrieval strategy is decoration. The 2026 standard is both: systems that look considered, and answers that can survive an audit.",
